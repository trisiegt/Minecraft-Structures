This is a list of Minecraft structures which you can copy into your world.
# How to obtain and use a structure block
To obtain a structure block:
```markdown
/give @s minecraft:structure_block 1
```
To use a structure block, you first need to download a NBT file. Then, you need to copy it to the path below:
```markdown
World save folder\generated\minecraft\structures
```
# Load a structure
To load a structure, place the block down (in a one block deep hole), and at the bottom left and click the button until it says "Load". Then at the top, type the name of the downloaded NBT data file (minus the .nbt part)
Finally, click "LOAD" at the bottom right. Then in chat it will say "Prepared [STRUCTURE].". Open the structure block, click "LOAD" again, and your structure will be loaded in.
